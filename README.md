Final Project

Background:
    How does the impact of a major war on THE U.S. stock market. Study the impact of the location of the war on the US stock market.
We roughly divide the situation into two categories, black swan events within the United States and black Swan events outside the United States, 
I will analyze the impact of the following two events on the American stock market.
Black swan events within the US: Sep, 2001, 9/11
Black swan events outside the US: Mar, 2003, Iraq War
Assuming we invest $10,000 during this period, how long after the event do we get a good return?


Steps:

1. Get stock "SPY(S&P 500)" details from an online open source database.
2. Date by month(after events)
3. Calculate Average, do some operations, logical algorithms to analyze the data.
4. Get result for final data analysis up or down, if we use $10,000 is the initial capital, 
and what will the final investment result be?
