Final Project

Background:


How does the impact of a major war on THE U.S. stock market. Study the impact of the location of the war on the US stock market.
We roughly divide the situation into two categories, black swan events within the United States and black Swan events outside the United States, 


I will analyze the impact of the following two events on the American stock market.
Black swan events within the US: Sep, 2001, 9/11
Black swan events outside the US: Mar, 2003, Iraq War



| Assuming we invest $10,000 into stock "SPY(S&P 500)"during this period, how long after the event do we get a good return?
