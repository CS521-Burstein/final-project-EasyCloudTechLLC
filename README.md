Q: How does the impact of a major war on THE U.S. stock market


I started to invest in American stocks last year, so I am interested in this project.

Background:

The STOCK market in the United States is always doing amazing things. Everything that happens in the world becomes a black swan event. 
The ongoing local war between Russia and Ukraine is also weighing on U.S. stocks. It is precisely because of these black swan events, 
such as war, COVID-19, inflation and other issues, that my personal investment is also affected. So I want to compare what happens to the S&P 500 
in the event of a major war.

Expectations:

1. Get stock details from an online open source database(S&P 500). Information: Month, Year, Price
2. Date by month(after war, price change): 1 month later, 3 months later, 6 months later, 12 months later
3. select geopolitical/military events:
               Dec, 1941, Pearl Habor |
               Oct, 1956, Suez Canal crisis |
               Oct, 1962, Cuban missile crisis |
               Oct, 1973, Arab oil embargo |
               Nov, 1979, Iranian hostage crisis |
               Dec, 1979, US.S.R. in Afghanistan |
               Aug, 1990, Iraq invades Kuwait |
               Jan, 1991, Gulf War |
               Aug, 1991, Gorbachev coup |
               Feb, 1993, World Trade Center bombing |
               Sep, 2001, 9/11 |
               Mar, 2003, Iraq War 
4. Calculate Average(check to see if the S&P 500 was profitable or losing during wartime)
5. Generate xlsx.file for final data analysis up or down
