Final Project

I started to invest in American stocks last year, so I am interested in this project. Compare data on two or more types of stocks to determine which have the best returns.

Background:

Since THE COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, the US government began to print unlimited money, which led to the crazy rise of stocks. For example, concept stocks like AMC soared from a few dollars to more than 300 dollars. This is a data worthy of study. But people also invest in big tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA). Like when people compare Buffett to arKK. There are a lot of open source data on the Internet, so IN this project, I will compare the return rates of two or more stocks from 2020 On January 1 to 2022 On January 31st.

Expectations:

Get stock details from an online open source database. Use basic data operation to analyze the final return rate of different types of stocks.
